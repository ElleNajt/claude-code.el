;;; mcp-tools.el --- Example MCP tools for claude-code.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Author: Claude Code Contributors
;; Version: 1.0.0
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "30.0") (claude-code "0.2.0"))
;; Keywords: tools, ai, mcp

;;; Commentary:
;; This file provides example MCP tools that can be exposed to Claude
;; through the claude-code.el MCP integration. These tools demonstrate
;; how to create functions that Claude can discover and execute.
;;
;; To use these tools:
;; 1. Load claude-code.el first to get the claude-code-defmcp macro
;; 2. Load this file: (load-file "examples/mcp-tools.el")  
;; 3. Start claude-code with MCP enabled
;; 4. Configure Claude Desktop to use the MCP server
;;
;; Functions defined with claude-code-defmcp are automatically discovered
;; and made available to Claude.

;;; Code:
